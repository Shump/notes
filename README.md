# My notes

Various notes and concepts I've collected related to programming, software
engineering or other topics.

## XY problem

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem:

> The XY problem is a communication problem encountered in help desk, technical
support, software engineering, or customer service situations where the
question is about an end user's attempted solution (Y) rather than the root
problem itself (X).

> Example: Asking about how to grab the last three characters in a filename (Y)
to get the file extension (X), since not all file extensions are three
characters long.

## [The Cost of Abstraction](https://250bpm.com/blog:86/index.html)

All functions introduce inherit cost to code readability. The benefit of
introducing the function (code duplication reduction, improved composition,
etc.) has to outweigh this inherit cost of abstraction.

Also related:
- KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid).
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), dual of this.

## Return Early Pattern

## TODO Title

The situation where a bunch of programmers spend hours of time in meetings
discussing the best solution (or even what solution) that could have been
otherwise implemented in a matter of minutes.
